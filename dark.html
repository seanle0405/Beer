			<p>The Belgian Dubbel is a rich, malty beer with some spicy or phenolic and mild alcoholic characteristics. Not as much fruitiness as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but some dark fruit aromas and flavors may be present. Medium amber to deep brown, this style is recognizable for its mild hop bitterness with no lingering hop flavors. A Dubbel is also likely show signs of a sweeter caramel flavor from the use of crystal malt or dark candi sugar. Look for a medium to full body with an expressive carbonation and some dryness in the finish. Traditionally a Trappist ale, many breweries now make similar "Abbey Dubbels" to try and emulate the monastic originals (Trappist Westvleteren 8, Westmalle Trappist Dubbel, and Chimay Premi√®re).</p>

			<p>Inspired by the Trappist brewers of Belgium, a Quadrupel is a Belgian-style ale of great strength with even bolder flavor compared to its sister styles Dubbel and Tripel. Typically a dark creation that plays within the deep red and ruby brown end of the spectrum with garnet hues it is a full bodied beer with a rich, malty palate and spicy phenols than are usually kept to a moderate level. Sweet on the palate with a low bitterness yet well perceived alcohol, Quads are well suited to cellaring. </p>
